# Dirlididi PLP
Repository for activities developed during the discipline of Programming Language Paradigms.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository

2.1. To run C and C++ files, use GCC:
```bash
gcc file.cpp -o file
```
2.2. To run Haskell files, use GHC:
```bash
ghci file.hs
```
2.3. To run Prolog files, use SWIPL:
```bash
swipl file.pl
```
### Prerequisites
Have GCC, GHC and SWIPL installed on the machine.

## Built With
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - GNU Compiler Collection
* [GHC/GHCi](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) - Glasgow Haskell Compiler
* [SWIPL](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) - SWI-Prolog
